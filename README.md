## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 1. UCSD Wireless Data Ingestion Framework [(`/wireless`)](https://github.com/Pratyusha-Adibhatla99/data-projects/tree/main/wireless)
**Role:** Research Assistant Data Engineer at UCSD.
**Framework:** Architected a Python and SQLite-based framework for HDF5, CSV, DAT, and PCD datasets.
**Automation:** Built batch ETL workflows using Azure Pipelines for automated metadata extraction and schema validation.
**Impact:** Reduced dataset discovery time to under 3 minutes through optimized metadata querie.

### 2. RAG Retrieval System (`/buffalo_housing_dashboard`)
**Role:** Research Assistant Data Engineer at University at Buffalo.
**Pipeline:** Designed a vector search pipeline to ingest unstructured data including video transcripts and OCR text.
**Vector Store:** Optimized metadata schemas and refreshed vector indexes in **ChromaDB** to ensure consistency.

### 3. CTS Bus Tracking System (`/CTS bus tracking/new final project`)
**Role:** Programmer Analyst Trainee at Cognizant.
**Tech Stack:** Built a Spring Boot (Java) and Angular full-stack application.
**Optimization:** Designed a relational database with REST APIs to handle daily location updates, reducing inconsistent records by 15-20%.

### 4. Eye-Controlled Wheelchair (`/eye-controlled wheelcha`)
* **Concept:** Assistive technology project developed using Raspberry Pi and Python.
* **Mechanism:** Translates eye/pupil movements into directional motor commands for mobility.


### 5. Professional Banking System (`/banking system`)
**Experience:** Inspired by data support work for Liberty Mutual Insurance.
**Data Integrity:** Developed SQL queries to update claims and payments data, validating 200-300 transactions per batch.
**Scale:** Supported production batch jobs processing over 100k transactions per month.
